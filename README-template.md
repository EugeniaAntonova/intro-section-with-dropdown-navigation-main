## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that there is a lot more to HTML and CSS that I must learn. This challenge was a little bit too challenging in terms of positioning.

### Continued development

I definetely need to learn more about semantics, BEM, planning, positioning.
